Fligh Ticket Booking System Used by reservation and  InGround (boarding gate) Team 

Screen 1 - Book Ticket 

Book / Update / Edit 
i/p Date , Mobile , Seat selection  (see MakeMytrp or Any app ) 3X3 flight with 30 Rows. Apply your own assumtion 
 
O/p Confirmation pop  Booking ID (system genrated ), Date , Mobile , Seat selected  
Max 6 seat for given number in a Day

i/p - Date 

O/p - List 
Seq No,   Booking ID ,  Seats booked ,  Mobile Logo (on click call gievn mobile ),   Button for marking traveler arrvied  

e.g 
Seq No,   Booking ID ,  Seats booked ,  Mobile Logo (on click call gievn mobile ),   Button for marking traveler arrvied 
1.       1111 ,  A1-A2-A3 ,  Logo , Button
2.       2111 ,  A10-A12 ,  Logo , Button
 

Assumption - 
    - person takes 60 sec to settle in his seat and blocks and no one can cross 
   - if ticket booked together all people in booking would get inside together 
   - all people booked in one booking ID would get in flight togther 
  - all people would be getting inside from front gate
  - walking time inside flight is negligible 
 
Algo( to be used in Screen 2 seq ) - Write algo that generate the sequence booking ID wise which takes minimum time for people to get inside flight 

eg  i/P 

Booking ID  seats  Phone  
111                 a1,a2   9999912345 
222                 a7    9999912346
333                 a15  9999912347

Option 1 sequence  - 240 sec time 

Seq   ID  seats 
1    111     a1,a2 , 9999912345
2   222     a7, 9999912346
3   333     a15, 9999912347

A1/a2 would block A7 and 15 for 60 sec 
A7 would block A15 for 60 sec 

Option 2 sequence  - 180 sec time 

Seq   ID  seats 
2   222     a7, 9999912346
1    111     a1,a2 , 9999912345
3   333     a15, 9999912347

A1/A2 would block 15 for 60 sec 

Option 3   sequance - 120 sec time 

Seq   ID  seats 
1    111     a15
2   222     a7, 9999912346
3   333     a1,a2, 9999912345

No one blocking
